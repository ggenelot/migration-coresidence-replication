* Main Stata do-files that reproduce tables and figures
********************************************************

1) Tables and graphs using the ENOE (Mexican Labor Force Survey)

statdesc_tables_JDE.do is a Stata do-file (written for version 14.2) that reproduces the following tables of descriptive statistics:  Table 1, Table 2 and Table 3, as well as Table A.1, A.2, A.3 and A.13 in the Appendix. 
It uses the following 8 data files:

- final_data_panel_105.dta 
- final_data_panel_205.dta 
- final_data_panel_305.dta 
- final_data_panel_405.dta
- final_data_panel_106.dta
- final_data_panel_206.dta
- final_data_panel_306.dta
- final_data_panel_406.dta

Each file corresponds to a panel dataset including the group of households that entered the ENOE survey in the quarter indicated by the last three digits (QYY) of the file's name. For example, final_data_panel_206.dta contains the households that entered the ENOE in the second quarter of 2006. 

regression_tables_JDE.do is a Stata do file that reproduces the following tables:

Table 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and Table 10 as well as Table A.4, A.5, A.6, A.7, A.8, A.9, A.10, A.11 and A.12 in the Appendix. It uses the same 8 data files as the do-file statdesc_Sep17_JDE.do. 

figures_JDE.do is a Stata do-file that reproduces the data underlying Figures 1 and 2. It uses the same 8 data files as the do-file statdesc_Sep17_JDE.do. 

2) Tables and graphs using the 2000 Mexican Population Census

analysis_census2000_JDE.do is a Stata do-file that reproduces Table 11 by using the following data files extracted from the 2000 Mexican Population Census: 

- PER_F_ent19_32.dta which includes individual level data in the Mexican States that are coded 19 to 32 
- PER_F_ent11_18.dta which includes individual level data in the Mexican States that are coded 11 to 18 
- PER_F_ent1_10.dta  which includes individual level data in the Mexican States that are coded 1 to 10 
- MIN_F.dta which includes individual level data on the international migrants (for all Mexican States)

* Construction of the main datasets 
************************************

1) ENOE data

The ENOE survey data can be readily dowloaded on the webpage of the INEGI, the Mexican National Statistical Office, at: 

http://www.beta.inegi.org.mx/proyectos/enchogares/regulares/enoe/default.html?init=2 

For each round of the ENOE survey, we use three datasets: COE2T.dta (individual questionnaire), HOGT.dta (household questionnaire), and SDEMT.dta (household roster).  
Building_ENOE_final_panel_datasets_JDE.do is a stata do-file that uses the raw input files of the ENOE survey rounds (from the first quarter of 2005 to the fourth quarter of 2007) and generates the 8 final datasets final_data_panel_105.dta, final_data_panel_205.dta, ..., final_data_panel406.dta that are used in the analysis. 
This do-file also uses as input the dataset CENSUS2000_MUNIP_MIGRUS.dta that includes municipal-level information on the number of emigrants from 1995 to 2000 and the 1995 total population. This dataset is generated by the do-file Building_census2000_Municip_Migration_JDE.do that in turn draws on the 2000 Mexican census (raw files  PER_F.dta and min_F.dta readily downloadable at www.inegi.org). Finally, the do-file bilateral relationships.do is used in the code of Building_ENOE_final_panel_datasets_JDE.do in order to generate the variables of family relationship between individuals of the same household. 


2) Census data

The 2000 Mexican census data can be readily dowloaded on the webpage of the INEGI, the Mexican National Statistical Office, at: 

http://www3.inegi.org.mx/sistemas/microdatos/default.aspx?c=14061&s=est

INEGI provides for each of the 32 Mexican States  two types of datasets: individual level questionnaire data (PER_F) and a individual proxy questionnaire specific to international migrant that left the household during the last 5 years (min_F). We append the PER_F datasets for the Mexican States coded from 1 to 10 in order to generate PER_F_ent1_10.dta. 
We append the PER_F datasets for the Mexican States coded from 11 to 18 in order to generate PER_F_ent11_18.dta. 
We append the PER_F datasets for the Mexican States coded from 19 to 32 in order to generate PER_F_ent19_32.dta.
